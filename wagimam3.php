         Dihfahsih also reminded us of the previous resolution that was passed in the general Wandidi meeting that we shall be meeting on family basis each month and joint Wandidi meetings when need arises<br>
         He remided us of the resolutions of working on small projects in each family as agreed up on in the previous meeting. <br>And as wagima family we had started on developing a clan website and he gave us its name <a href="http://bamugoya.000webhostapp.com/">Mugoya Clan Website</a>.<br></p>
         He also suggested that we print Wagima Tshirts for identification at the annual general meeting<br>
         The chair invited one of our Wagima family household elder<a style="text-decoration: none" href="16.php">Wagima Silver </a> to give us a speech.<br>
         <p style=" ">
         <b>Mzee Silver</b> started by appreciating everyone for attending the meeting especially he was happy to see Brenda, Boaz and Wakoli as it was their first time to attend the meeting<br>
         He ssaid that every month there is an executive meeting of Mugoya Clan held and he has a role of a secretary on that committee.<br></p>
         <p style=" ">
         He also reminded us of Wandidi annual meeting on the 27th December every year in the village. He also said as bamugoya we have a consistitution that has objectives that we follow and guide each one of us as the members of the clan.<br>
         Mzee Silver tasked the chair to select a representative from each house-hold to help in registration of all wagima members from parents upto grand children level. He said this would help us know all our family members so as to cater for them.<br>
          </p>
          
                <h6>Minute 4. Matters rising from members</h6>
         <p style=" ">
          <b> Wakoli</b> suggested that we create a whatsapp platform to foster easy communication and sharing of information. In quick response Jackie responded that by the end of the meeting the whatsapp group would be a success<br></p>
           <p style=" ">
           <b>Faith</b> suggested that we start up a foundation as a way of giving back to the community at the all levels, this was welcomed by Mzee Silver who named it Wagima foundation.<br>
           Wakoli also suggested that we create one day in a year we as wagima family to have a day of fellowship to gether and thank God of what he has done for us.with great joy every member welcomed his idea<br></p>
           <p style=" ">
           <b>Boaz</b> suggested that we open up a wagima bank account on which contributions towards the Wagima Foundations can be made by willing members.<br></p>
           <p style=" ">
           <b>Jackie(Wagima Family Secretary)</b> suggested that everyone becomes an ambassador to other family members by reminding them to come for the meetings so that everyone is inclusive in what is going on in our family<br></p>
           <p style=" ">
           The Chair mentioned that Mudebo and Lyakoobe families decided to have combined that were to be held the next week, he suggested that one member should represent the wagima family but Mzee silver declined and said let them also show sign of maturity we shall go there when we see there is a need<br>
         </p>
          <h6>Minute 5. Any Other Business</h6>
         <p style=" ">
         Mzee Silver said that we should make 30th December a day of Wagima Annual meeting in the village, but in quick response <b>Brenda</b> refuted that saying most of them also have meetings to attend to on 30th December so that couldn't favor them.<br></p>
         <p style=" ">
         After a lot of deliberations we agreed that a day of wagima general meeting will be discussed about in the coming meetiings.<br>
         We agreed that we shall be meeting every first sunday of the month and the next meeting was scheduled to take place on 2nd september 2018.

        </p>

        The chair called upon Mzee silver to give us a closing prayer. after the prayer <b>Dickson</b> started taking pictures of the members who had attended the meeting<br>
        We then departed physically but remained in the same spirit til the next meeting.</p>
