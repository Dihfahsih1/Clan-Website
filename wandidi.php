                <b>Chairperson of Abdallah Family(Waludde Kenneth)</b>
                <p>
                    They had one meeting in which they suggested to go to the village and organise a day to rebuild the graves of their ancestors that have wapped.<br>
                    They agreed on a budget of about 2millions to cater for repairing the damaged graves and they had pledged about shs. 700000 as a family.<br>
                    They tried to tackle discipline among the members, but they were soliciting for help from elders of the lineage so as to cub indiscipline<br>

                </p>
                <b>Chairperson of Lyakobe family(Wambedde Paul)</b>
                <p>
                    In the past 3 months since July, they held only one meeting, in this meeting they intended to know each other as a family<br>
                    They also used this meeting to settle wrangles among the family members and they reconciled(Mzee Makabayi had a dispute with his son but this was handled and solved).<br>
                </p>
