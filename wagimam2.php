           <h4>Starting The Meeting Discussions</h4>
          <p>Dihfahsih gave us an openning prayer.<br>
             The meeting was intended to be for the entire Wandidi Lineage as agreed upon in the previous meeting held on 10th June 2018.<br>
             Dihfahsih reviewed the minutes of the previous meeting.</p>
             <h4>An agreement on Family Monthly Meetings</h4>
             <p> Mzee started by explaining the importance of dividing our monthly meetings upto family basis. Among the importaces he pointed out include the following
             <ul>
                 <li>It will make it easy to track down those who dodge meetings easily</li>
                 <li>It will help us get to know each other very well </li>
                 <li> It will create alot of innovativeness in our Wandidi Lineage in form of small projects</li>
                 <li>It will enable us handle our pressing issues very well due to proper mutual interactions in families</li>
             </ul> 
             <p>He then asked the 3 chairs representing each family as chosen in the previous meeting whether we should start meeting on family basis and not as the entire Lineage.</p>
             <p>All the 3 (Waludde, Wambedde and Dihfahsih) agreed that we should meet as families.
             Wambedde suggested that we choose some dates we meet as a Wandidi Lineage</p>
             <p>Mzee Silver suggested that we shall be meeting as Wandidi after 3 months to evaluate family monthly meetings and all the members agreed to his suggestion.</p>
            
           <h4>Important Points Made</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>We agreed that Mass Graduation will be discussed in families and the resolutions passed will be communicated during Wandidi meeting.</li>
                <li>We also agreed that we shall organise a day and celebrate the life of those that died so that we can tap in the blessings they had.</li>
                <li>Mwanga Was chosen as a replacement of Mzee Micheal as a mobiliser of entire Wandidi Kampala Group.</li>
                <li>Namono Jackline and Mugoya Fred were chosen to mobilise Nsambya Group </li>
                <li>We agreed that we start on registration of families that make up Wandidi and this was to be done in our family meetings.</li>
                <li> Each family was to set dates and venue for their monthly meetings.</li>
                <li>We agreed that we shall meet again as Wandidi in September and in december.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Mzee gave us a closing prayer and we departed physically but remained in the same spirit till we meet again.
