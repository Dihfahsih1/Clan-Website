        <p><b>Minute 1: Prayer</b> Dihfahsih led us in prayer</p>
          	<p><b>Minute 2: Introduction of Members</b> Members introduced themselves by their names, work and place of residence.</p>
          	<p>
          		<b>This meeting was led by the Wagima Family as we had agreed to have each family chair a weekly Wandidi Meeting</b>
          		<h5><b>Minute 3: Communication from the chair (Mzee Micheal Buwasi)</b></h5>
          		He startrd by thanking members for turning up for the meeting in large number. He said such meetings should be happening so often.<br>
          		We had agreed in previous meeting that each family starts leading or chairing Wandidi  meetings. This was successfully done with Lyakoobe meeting on 20th May 2018 and Abdallah chairing on 27th May 2018 held at nsambya<br>
          		He continued by saying we need to work together to bring our families together especially knowing all our relatives.<br>
          		He suggested that we combine prayer for deceased with celebrations for those who have graduated in April during Holiday<br>
          	</p>
          	<p>
          		<h5><b>Minute 4: Reactions from Members</b></h5>
          		<b>Mzee Mushedu</b> said everyone should be receiving messages notifying them about the meeting and we select a representative for each household<br>
          		He said most children don't know their elders and he added that we should select the day for graduation celebrations before we leave the meeting.<br>
          		<b>David</b> Said that We need to plan of how to make graduation celebrations a success.<br>
          		<b>Ms Anyait</b> Said we should elect the commitee and suggest how much each member will contribute towards the success of graduation celebrations.<br>
          		<b>Dorothy</b> Appreciated the clan for the love and support extended towards her. She supported the idea of making a mass graduation and praying for the deceased<br>
          		<b>Mugoya Dihfahsih</b> He promised that he will develop a website for our clan and most of the information will be posted there.<br>
          		<b>Mzee Silver</b> Suggested that we separate the two fuctions of mass graduation and rememberance of the deceased because the two are totally contradicting.
          		He explained that the purpose of mass graduation is to show to the young ones that we as the mugoya clan we study till we complete and graduate<br>
          		He said that the committee that will be elcted should make sure that collecting money should not be their priority rather uniting the members.<br>

          	</p>
          	<b><u><i><h4>Electing Family Chairs</h4></i></u></b>
          	<p>
          		Mzee Micheal suggested that we elect <b> Waludde Kenneth</b> as the chair for Abdallah Mudebo Family, all members agreed and he was elected.<br>
          		Mzee Silver Suggested that we elect <b>Wambedde Paul</b> to chair Lyakoobe Family and he was overwhelmingly elected by members.<br>
          		Mzee Mushedu suggested that we select <b>Mugoya Dihfahsih</b> as a chair of Akabu Wagima family and members agreed and he was elected.<br>
          		<b>Miriam Wawomola</b> was selected to represent the Jinja Wandidi Group.
          	</p>
          	<p><b>Kenneth</b> Suggested that our elders should emphasize discipline among the members because most of them are so undisciplined.<br>
          	<b>Anthony</b>Accepted the issue of not knowing their elders and attributed this problem to their parents who don't introduce them to their relatives at an early age of their lives.<br>
          	<b>Mzee Silver</b>Said that whoever has been given responsibility should ensure that he or she works without hesitation and then give us a report the next time we meet as Wandidi<br>
          	<b>Wambedde</b> Suggested that we set a date and we air out our issues because alot of members have burning issues but time is limited<br></p>
          	<h5>Minute 5: Closure</h5>
          	<p> 
               We agreed that we hold another Wandid meeting on 8th July 2018 before we start meeting as families.<br>
               Mzee Silver gave us a closing prayer and we departed physically but remained in the same spirit until we meet again
